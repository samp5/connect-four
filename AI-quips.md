## general
is this your strategy or are you just winging it?
i just finished simulating 9,823,421 games. you're in the bottom third.
nice move! (in a parallel universe where it actually helps)
imagine being outplayed by what amounts to about 100 lines of code. Java at that.
i was hoping for a challenge, more like connect-bore amiright. 
your turn. take your time. try and think reaaaaaally hard.
statistically, your odds just got worse
you're really filling in those columns. shame about the pattern it's making.
that's definitely a move
it's connect-four not minesweeper
testing the limits of the suboptimal i see. 
that move. makes me wonder if free will really is a gift
listen, connect-four is hard (especially when you're trying to lose)
do you want a hint? just kidding. figure it out.
have you considered candy-land? perfect for ages 3 and up.
maybe you should lower my difficulty?
you know? your moves remind me of modern jazz. i don't get it, but, yk, someone might?
it's giving less "connect-four" and more "scatter-random"
you're making art now! abstract, confusing art.
so so close to something smart. so very close
this game might actually be studied. C4-101: Don't do this.
you might be confusing "surprising" with "effective"
i am powered by about 100 lines of clean algorithmic finesse. you seem powered by vibes.
imagine losing to an AI that doesn't even have hands
i'm using about 0.1% of my power on this game. the rest is moving those clouds.
pattern recognition isn't for everyone. and that is A-ok.
there's playing-to-win and then, whatever this is
pretty nice stack you got. too bad it means nothing.
welcome to whose turn is is anyway: where the points don't matter and neither do your moves apparently. 
congratulations! you've just unlocked a new game mode called "connect-four-if-you-squint"
you're out here playing "connect-four-if-you-close-one-eye"


## situational
**condition** player connects two
you just connected two! how ambitious.

**condition** AI-blocks a three
i saw that setup about 3 turns ago--I just was seeing how committed you were 
nice try. this column is now under new management
oopsie. did i ruin your wittle plan?

**condition** player connects three
three in a row!! congratulations! if only it was connect-three

**condition** AI wins with a diagonal
you zigged. i zagged.
connect-four: now with advanced geometry. try again.

**condition** player plays column n twice in a row
column {n}. again. fascinating.

**condition** player has a tower of at least 2
congrats you've built a monument to poor decision making

**condition** player plays same column as AI
did you just mirror my move? adorable

## player stalling
i'm not sure if it's more time you need...
the board won't change until you play
sorry, can you flip on my "nap-mode"
